## Solution Statement
```
Produce a game that
    supports a fun experience for the player that
        is easy to play
            because it has
                an intuitive interface
                simple game rules

        is convenient to play
            because it is
                available on all devices
            because it has
                short game periods

        is entertaining to play
            because it has
                a modern user interface
                flashy action and result animations
                an immersive game atmosphere

        is playable at different scopes
            among 
                friends
                communities
                states
                countries
            globally

    supports monetization that
        is legally considered a game of skill 
            because
                performance is dictated primarily by skill
        
        exploits gambling addiction
            by
                implementing psychological tactics similar to casinos
                influencing players to make emotional decisions as opposed to logical

        exploits competitive human nature
            by
                implementing leaderboards
                implementing social media leaderboards, comparisons, statistics
                allowing players to share their achievement while masking their failure

    supports both fun and monetization 
        by
            allowing players to wager and earn money
                by purchasing points via any major currency
                by wagering these points competing against others
```

## Conditionals
```
We fail in proving legality
    introduce added complexity to the game to meet threshold
    or seek alternate monetization model
        such as
            remove ability to purchase credits with currency
            or remove ability to cashout in-game credits for currency
            or introduce way to earn in-game credits
            or distribute in-game credits on a daily basis
                and allow players to purchase speed-ups

We fail to hold user engagement (game isn't fun)
    introduce added complexity to the game
    or add new gametypes to game
    or modify the user experience to be more engaging
