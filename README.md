# Frenemy
Intuitive, easy to pick up and play mobile game that allows players to test their wits against strangers for money.

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine. Make sure you have nodeJS and npm (package manager) installed on your machine. Run `npm install` while in the home directory of the project. This will install the project's dependencies. I also suggest install `nodemon` globally on your machine, which will automatically detect changes to the server file and restart the node process. Once the process is running access the page at `http://localhost:8080`.
